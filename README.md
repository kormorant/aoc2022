Advent of Code 2022 solves

All written in Python, and all of them hacky bodge jobs.
Only saved for posterity.

Day 1 through 3 only have part 2. I overwrote part 1 to create part 2 on those days. I started to bother creating separate files for the separate parts on day 4.

These files need input to function. These can be found on adventofcode.com, under the 2022 event.

Note about day 5:
While some wrote a parser to ingest the original state of the given crates, I opted to simply enter them manually into a hardcoded list. To enable the code to run, the actual instructions should be saved to a separate file.
